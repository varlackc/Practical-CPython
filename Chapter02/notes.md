# Chapter 02 Notes
In chapter two we explored the CPython source code.
We explore how to get the source code and how to navigate inside the repository.
It is assumed that the reader will have git installed in their local system.
The CPython source code was included in the cpython folder.
The addition of cpython will make it easier for the reader to make changes
to CPython locally.

Notice that you might need to use the cpython code provided to try the examples
in future chapters.
