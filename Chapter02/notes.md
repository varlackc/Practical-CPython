# Chapter 02 Notes
In chapter two we explored the CPython source code.
We explore how to get the source code and how to navigate inside the repository.
It is assumed that the reader will have git installed in their local system.
The CPython project was included as a git submodule.
The addition of cpython will make it easier for the reader to make changes to CPython locally.
In case of having issues with the submodule, you can reinizialize the submodule.
`git submodule update --init`

Notice that cpython content is relatively large. Changes will take time to take effect.

Notice that you might need to use the cpython code provided to try the examples
in future chapters.
