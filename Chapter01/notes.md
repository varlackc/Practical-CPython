# Notes for Chapter 01
In chapter one we have an introduction of CPython.
We cover the basics of CPython and why we should learn its inner workings.
We also explored some basic concepts such as compilers and interpreters.

In this directory you will see examples of C programs provided in chapter one.
Some of the files included in this directory include:
c_controls.c
c_functions.c
py_comments.py

The c_controls.c file shows how the control structures are used in c.
The c_functions.c file shows how functions are used in c.
The py_comments.py file shows how comments are used in python.
