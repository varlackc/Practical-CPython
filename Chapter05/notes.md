# Chapter 05 Notes
In chapter five we explored the CPython underlying architecture.
In this directory we have the following files:
* ast.py
* dis.py
* python.gram
* Tokens
The ast.py file shows how abstract syntax trees work.
The dis.py file shows how the bytecode works.
The python.gram file shows the modified grammar in CPython.
The Tokens file shows the modified tokens in CPython.
